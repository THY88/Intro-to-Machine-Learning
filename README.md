# Intro-to-Machine-Learning
This repo contains the various projects deliverable for the Temasek Poly KnowITGetIT Intro to Machine Learning Nanodegree hosted by Udacity.

The 3 projects are:

1. Finding Donors for CharityML
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. The project's goal is to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

2. Create Your Own Image Classifier - TensorFlow
This project uses the Oxford Flower 102 Dataset in Tensorflow Dataset. The goal of the project is to develop an AI model using tensorflow that will be able to learn from a labelled training set of flower pictures and to be able to predict the flower categories for unseen data. The project requires understanding of various AI concepts such as building artificial networks, preprocessing workflows, transfer learning and regularisation of models. 


3.Creating Customer Segments with Arvato
In this project, we work with real-life data provided by AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign.
The project requires the use of unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, we will also need to assess and clean the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.
